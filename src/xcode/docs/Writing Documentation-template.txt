# Writing Documentation #

Classes are documented in the `.h` files. Documentation sets can be generated
using [appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/). Generating the API docs is
documented on
[Confluence](http://macserver.itude.com/confluence/display/MOBBL/Generating+API+docs).

Additional documentation like this document is generated from the files in the
`docs` directory. You can use [markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) 
for markup.

By appending `-template` to the filename of the documentation file, the file
is processed by the `appledoc` tool to resolve any cross-references you use.
For example, this page is generated from `docs/Writing
Documentation-template.txt`. You can insert references to class names like
MBDocument or to additional documentation pages like Layers.
